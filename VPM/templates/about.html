    <h1>Hello folks! I'm Apoorvi.</h1>
    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        Welcome to <strong>VPM (Visual Product Matcher)</strong>. It is simple yet powerful tool that helps you find products similar to an image you upload or provide via URL.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        Our goal is to make product discovery easier and faster. Your shopping experience for <strong>fashion apparels</strong> with VPM gets simplified as it uses advanced <em>image feature extraction</em> and <em>similarity matching</em> techniques to show you the closest matches.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        The platform is built with <strong>Django</strong> and leverages <strong>machine learning features</strong> to compare products across categories. We focus on providing a clean, minimal, and user-friendly interface for a smooth experience.
    </p>

    <p style="margin-bottom: 1rem;">
        This project is currently in development. In the coming version it will have better accuracy, more categories, and enhanced the overall design.
    </p>

        Thank you for trying VPM. I hope it makes your product search effortless!
